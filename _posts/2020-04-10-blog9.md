## Proxmox VE
Proxmox is an open-source virtualization management based on QEMU/KVM and LXC. It provides deployment and management of containers and virtuals machines. Proxmox can run any hardware, Which can start with a single node and scale-out to a large set of clustered nodes. The central principle of the Proxmox is to make admin management easier.

<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
These requirements only for assessment before a bigger deployment
<ul>
  <li>CPU: 64bit (Intel EMT64 or AMD64)</li>
  <li>Intel VT/AMD-V capable CPU/Mainboard for KVM full virtualization support</li>
  <li>RAM: 1 GB RAM, plus additional RAM used for guests</li>
  <li>Hard drive</li>
  <li>One NIC</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recommended System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intel EMT64 or AMD64 with Intel VT/AMD-V CPU flag</li>
  <li>Memory, minimum 2 GB for the OS and Proxmox VE services. Plus designated memory for guests. For Ceph and ZFS additional memory is required; approximately 1GB of memory for every TB of used storage</li>
  <li>Fast and redundant storage, best results are achieved with SSDs</li>
  <li>OS storage: Use a hardware RAID with battery protected write cache (“BBU”) or non-RAID with ZFS (optional SSD for ZIL)</li>
  <li>VM storage</li>
  <li>Redundant (Multi-)Gbit NICs with additional NICs depending on the preferred storage technology and cluster setup</li>
  <li>For PCI(e) passthrough the CPU needs to support the VT-d/AMD-d flag</li>
</ul>
