## Create a Personal Blog on GitHub pages With Jekyll themes
Create personal blog with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/) There is more than one way to do it, I found this way easier, just using Jekyll theme itself. <br /> Here is tutorial how to do it with Jekyll, its will teach more about Jekyll frame work: [Jekyll Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)

First we Create a new repository

we need to clone our new repository
copy this link

open terminal type navigate to your desired folder and type
{% highlight git %}
git clone git@github.com:User/USER.github.io.git
{% endhighlight %}

It will clone your new repository then go and find your [jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
find a theme you like and open their GitHub I used a texture from [thelehhman](https://github.com/thelehhman/texture) clone their repository to a different folder than your repository you created earlier

{% highlight git %}
git clone https://github.com/thelehhman/texture.git
{% endhighlight %}

now copy theme folder content to the folder of your repository if folders in the same directory use this command for mac terminal
{% highlight git %}
cp -a source/. destination
{% endhighlight %}

Or move/copy your content files with ctrl+c for copy and ctrl+v to paste.

here are examples the files inside of your repository

in your terminal type
{% highlight git %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}

to see your files in your repository folder, we need to commit them to your Github account

{% highlight git %}
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
{% endhighlight %}

now you can go to your github account and see all your theme files. Go yo your settings
